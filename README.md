SQL Analytics: Adidas Sales Insights Project

The Adidas SQL analytics project was designed to analyze sales data and derive actionable insights to support strategic business growth. Using relational databases, raw sales data was transformed into meaningful metrics, providing a granular view of performance across product categories, collections, regions, and store types.

Comprehensive Metrics Analysis: Calculated total costs, sales, revenue, and profit margins across product lines such as running shoes, training gear, and accessories. The analysis revealed performance variations across store types (flagship, outlet, online) and delivery efficiency metrics.
Seasonal and Regional Trends: Evaluated seasonal revenue fluctuations and payment preferences, providing actionable insights into peak sales periods and customer purchasing habits. Inventory levels were analyzed regionally to identify surplus stock and regional product demand.
Inventory and Pricing Insights: Identified high-inventory, low-sales products to optimize stock levels and highlighted items with the highest discount rates, enabling better pricing strategies.
SQL-Driven Decision Support: Leveraged SQL queries to address critical business questions, such as improving inventory turnover, enhancing sales channel distribution, and optimizing promotional offers for maximum impact.
Key Recommendations:

Focus selling efforts on high-potential, fast-moving products like Ultraboost sneakers.
Implement data-driven inventory solutions to minimize overstock and reduce holding costs.
Optimize delivery methods to ensure timely fulfillment and improve customer satisfaction.
Leverage seasonal trends to align marketing campaigns and stock levels, maximizing sales opportunities during peak periods.
Tailor pricing strategies to enhance profitability, including reevaluating discount structures and promotional campaigns.
This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can guide inventory management, channel optimization, and strategic pricing, ultimately enhancing Adidas's overall sales performance and customer experience.
